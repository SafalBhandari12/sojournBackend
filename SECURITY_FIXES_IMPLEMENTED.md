# Security Fixes and Enhancements Implemented

## üîí Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **Sensitive Data Exposure in API Responses**

**Issue**: Booking endpoints were exposing sensitive payment data including:

- Razorpay payment signatures
- Internal transaction IDs
- Raw payment gateway responses
- Full customer phone numbers to vendors

**Fix**: Created comprehensive data sanitization system with `SecurityUtils` class:

#### Data Sanitization Features:

- **Phone Number Masking**: `maskPhoneNumber()` - Shows only last 2 digits to non-owners
- **Payment Data Cleaning**: `sanitizePaymentData()` - Removes sensitive payment fields
- **Public Booking References**: `generatePublicBookingRef()` - Non-enumerable booking IDs
- **Role-based Data Filtering**: Different data exposure levels for customers vs vendors

### 2. **Enhanced Booking Endpoints with Customer Information**

#### Updated Endpoints:

1. **`GET /vendor/bookings`** - Enhanced with:

   - Customer phone numbers (masked)
   - Search functionality by booking ID, phone, room number
   - Secure pagination
   - Payment status without sensitive details

2. **`GET /customer/bookings`** - Enhanced with:

   - Sanitized payment information
   - Hotel and vendor contact details
   - Room amenities and details
   - No sensitive payment gateway data

3. **`GET /bookings/:bookingId`** - Enhanced with:
   - Role-based data access (customer vs vendor view)
   - Supports both hotel booking ID and main booking ID
   - Comprehensive sanitization based on user permissions

#### New Endpoint:

4. **`GET /vendor/bookings/search/:bookingId`** - New endpoint for:
   - Direct booking search by ID
   - Vendor-specific access control
   - Detailed booking information with customer details (masked)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Improvements

### Data Protection Measures:

- **No Razorpay Signatures**: Removed from all API responses
- **No Internal Transaction IDs**: Replaced with public booking references
- **Masked PII**: Phone numbers masked unless user is the owner
- **Payment Data Filtering**: Only essential payment status/method exposed
- **Role-based Access**: Different data views for customers vs vendors

### Search Capabilities Added:

- Search by partial booking ID
- Search by customer phone number (vendors only)
- Search by room number
- Maintains security during search operations

## üìã Response Structure Examples

### Vendor Booking List Response:

```json
{
  "bookings": [
    {
      "bookingRef": "BK1A2B3C4D",
      "status": "CONFIRMED",
      "checkInDate": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
      "checkOutDate": "2025-01-17T00:00:00.000Z",
      "numberOfGuests": 2,
      "totalAmount": 5000,
      "createdAt": "2025-01-10T10:30:00.000Z",
      "customer": {
        "phoneNumber": "********89"
      },
      "room": {
        "type": "Deluxe",
        "number": "101"
      },
      "payment": {
        "status": "SUCCESS",
        "method": "RAZORPAY"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Customer Booking List Response:

```json
{
  "bookings": [
    {
      "bookingRef": "BK1A2B3C4D",
      "status": "CONFIRMED",
      "checkInDate": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
      "checkOutDate": "2025-01-17T00:00:00.000Z",
      "numberOfGuests": 2,
      "totalAmount": 5000,
      "hotel": {
        "name": "Grand Hotel",
        "address": "123 Hotel Street, City",
        "contactNumbers": ["+91-1234567890"]
      },
      "room": {
        "type": "Deluxe",
        "number": "101",
        "amenities": ["WiFi", "AC", "TV"]
      },
      "payment": {
        "paymentStatus": "SUCCESS",
        "paymentMethod": "RAZORPAY",
        "totalAmount": 5000,
        "processedAt": "2025-01-10T10:35:00.000Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## ‚úÖ Compliance Achieved

- **PII Protection**: Phone numbers masked appropriately
- **Payment Security**: No sensitive payment gateway data exposed
- **Access Control**: Role-based data filtering implemented
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data included in responses
- **Audit Trail**: Public booking references for tracking without exposing internal IDs

## üöÄ Additional Features

### Enhanced Search & Filter:

- Query parameter `search` for booking ID, phone, room number
- Status filtering maintained
- Pagination with secure data exposure
- Customer details visible to vendors (with masking)

### Backward Compatibility:

- All existing endpoints continue to work
- Enhanced with security measures
- New search endpoint as additional feature

## üîß Implementation Notes

- **SecurityUtils Class**: Centralized data sanitization logic
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript typing maintained
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- **Performance**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing support
- **Maintainability**: Clean, documented, and modular code structure
